# ALEX-Telegram

This package contains a telegram bot that listens for /query commands and sends them to a query builder server. We host one instance, which can be found [here](telegram.me/geo_query_bot).

To run it yourself, you will have to supply a telegram api token. This token needs to be put in the token.txt file. You will also have to install the requirements.txt in the root folder.

After that, run:

```python
python geo_query_bot.py
```
